    <p>The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) in a now-withdrawn notification had announced to recruit Joint Secretaries, Directors and Deputy Secretaries through lateral entry. The announcement witnessed criticism from opposition parties, claiming it undermines the reservation rights of OBCs, SCs and STs, which forced the Narendra Modi government to revoke the decision</p>
